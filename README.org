* Preliminary aspects

** Platform support

Linux and Windows.

** Tech stack

- Language: C (*gnu17* - *ISO C 2017* [~ISO/IEC 9899:2018~] with *GNU extensions*)
- Compiler: Clang (v16)
- Vulkan (v1.3.x)

** Project structure

#+begin_src mermaid
mindmap
  root(("Engine (shared)"))
    ("Hot-reloadable code (shared)")
      ("Game (exec)")
    ("Test (exec)")
    ("Editor (exec)")
#+end_src

** Feature list

- Lightweight build system (GNU Make)
- Low-level utilities (dynamic arrays, string handling, etc.)
- Platform layer (Linux and Windows abstractions for windowing, input, console interaction, etc.)
- Logger (debugging purposes)
- File I/O capabilities
- Application layer
- Renderer and API abstraction layer
- Memory management (custom allocators, etc.)
- Entity Component System (ECS)
- Profiling and debugging utilities
- Scripts support via hot-realoadable modules
- Physics system

** Engine architecture

* Build

WGE ships with a ready-to-go ~Makefile~, so *GNU Make* is needed in order to build the engine. It is as simple as doing:
#+begin_src sh
$  make
#+end_src
By default, it targets the *Linux platform* (e.g. /GNU/Linux/). In order to build the project for Windows, it will be needed the *MinGW-w64* compiler suite in order to cross-compile it. With all that setup, it can be specified by doing:
#+begin_src sh
$  make TARGET=windows
#+end_src

* Usage
